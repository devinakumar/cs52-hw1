Code for a landing page with HTML/CSS

This is a git repository for a landing page coded entirely in HTML and CSS.  For my landing page, I used primarily flexboxes to align all of the elements on my page.  The basic HTML layout mainly consisted of unordered lists with some inputs.

 The flexboxes allowed me to transition to the mobile version in a manner simpler than realigning everything again.  Many of the switches from a larger to a smaller screen included making the layout columnar instead of row-based.  Another tool that I used to transition from a larger to a smaller screen was the display toggle; some elements of the webpage were not quite as necessary for the smaller screen, so the toggle allowed me to filter what I believed was important from unimportant.
